# OpenGD77
New GD-77 open source firmware written from scratch.

# Project status

The project is currently in a stabilizing phase and on feature freeze. Please see the road map below for details.
This is to make sure that we use our development time in a coordinated way and make the most of it. Please keep in mind that the project is run on our free time.

Your contribution is welcome in all areas. But please understand that in the current phase our priority is on testing, bug reports and bug fixes. Ideas for changes and/or features will get recorded but have to wait for now.
If you want to contribute coding please get in touch first, so we can coordinate the work. To keep integration efforts manageable we need to follow a development process.
